## WEIGHT BUDGET

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| 4x LX-16A servos | 216g |
| 4x 85mm rubber wheels | ~200g |
| 4x goBILDA couplers | 24g |
| 3D printed frame | ~350g |
| 2S 5000mAh LiPo | ~270g |
| Raspberry Pi + electronics | ~150g |
| Lidar | ~170g |
| Wiring, misc | ~100g |
| **TOTAL** | **~1.5 kg** |

Well under the 2.5kg design target - excellent thrust margin.

## POWER BUDGET

| Component | Current @ 7.4V |
|-----------|----------------|
| 4x LX-16A (cruise) | 0.4A |
| 4x LX-16A (peak) | 4.0A |
| Raspberry Pi (via 5V) | 0.5A equiv |
| Lidar | 0.3A equiv |
| **Total Cruise** | **~1.5A** |
| **Total Peak** | **~5A** |

5000mAh 2S battery runtime: 5000mAh / 1500mA = **~3.3 hours cruise**

## SERVO BUS WIRING

All 4 servos daisy-chain on a single 3-wire bus:

```
Power (7.4V) ────┬────┬────┬────┐
                 │    │    │    │
GND ─────────────┼────┼────┼────┤
                 │    │    │    │
Signal ──────────┼────┼────┼────┤
                 │    │    │    │
              [S1]  [S2]  [S3]  [S4]
               FL    FR    RL    RR
```

Each servo has unique ID (set via Hiwonder debug tool):
- ID 1: Front Left
- ID 2: Front Right
- ID 3: Rear Left
- ID 4: Rear Right
